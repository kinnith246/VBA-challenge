# VBA-challenge
Kenneth Le's VBA Challenge assignment.
In this challenge we were to use VBA scripting to analyse generated stock data and output specific results.
I have attached a file, the script code and screenshots of my results.
I used resources from the class activities and some googling to find the solutions to some of my code.
I have also included a test file I used to make edits and updates to my code to see if it runs properly.
Source code for my VBA script can be found in the files named "Code for VBA Challenge - Kenneth Le"

When the VBA script runs, it outputs the ticker names, the open and close price for the quarter, calculates the quarterly change (close price - open price) then calculates that into a precentage and the total volume of each ticker as required.
The script also highlights positive and negative changes for both the quarterly change and the percentage change
As part of the bonus, the script also outputs the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
