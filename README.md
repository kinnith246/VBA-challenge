# VBA-challenge
Kenneth Le's VBA Challenge assignment.
In this challenge we were to use VBA scripting to analyse generated stock data and output specific results.
I have attached a file, the script code and screenshots of my results.
I used resources from the class activities and some googling to find the solutions to some of my code.
I have also included a test file I used to make edits and updates to my code to see if it runs properly.
Source code for my VBA script can be found in the files named "Code for VBA Challenge - Kenneth Le"
